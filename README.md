# HOW I DID IT AND WHAT I LEARNT
I really learnt a lot and enjoyed a lot while building this. I began to think in a broad way! I learnt how  to use Teachable Machine and a bit od ML., This journey has been very fun and exciting!!! Moreover, I developed self-learning!
I got an overview of how a model is trained and how ML can be used!
